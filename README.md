# Mark Nifakos Eagle Project

## Project Log

### December 22, 2017:

I briefed my scoutmaster over an abstract idea for the project. He told me I needed to get someone at the Parks and Rec. department to validate my proposal. I was also told that I need to research what the project entails, cost, potential for scout labor; all of this compiled into an informal glimpse of the problem and solution I can tell my contact at Parks and Rec.

### January 29, 2018:

I sent an email to Cassie Warthen, the chairwoman of the Satellite Beach Parks and Recreation department, outlining my plan for a net to prevent soccer balls from landing in a deep water-filled ditch on the outskirts of the field.

### February 13, 2018:

I got a response from Mrs. Warthen by email. She said that the DeSoto Soccer fields would be under construction later in the calendar year; consequently, it would not be ideal for my project according to her. She asked if I had time to meet with her to come up with other ideas for projects around Satellite Beach.

### February 15, 2018:

I have fallen ill with a severe sinus infection this week; this I counted in an email to Mrs. Warthen and that I would communicate with her when I recovered. After this I received no further correspondence from Mrs. Warthen, despite my clear approbation of her willingness to respond in the final line of the email. I have resolved to scrap the net idea and look for project opportunities with the Pass the Torch Inc nonprofit, recently incorporated on 2401 Post Road.

### February 25, 2018:

I met with Dan Walton, my scoutmaster and one of the board members of Pass the Torch Inc, at a café. We discussed several projects that will need to be constructed as some point or another at the building on 2401 Post Road.

### June 5, 2018:

I decided to build a woodshed on the south side of the main building as my project. I again met with Mr. Walton to go over the process of planning and executing an Eagle project. I left with a detailed plan for how to complete the requirements in order and a project proposal sheet. I am able to access on our troop website a list of previous Eagle scouts and their documents they wrote when planning their own projects.

### June 19, 2018:

I began making CAD drawings to produce a rendering of the finished project in nearly full detail.

### July 11, 2018:

I completely finished the CAD drawings. The only thing left is to tweak the measurements to make workable 2D technical drawings, which I plan to do after my proposal is approved.

### July 17, 2018:

I send the email to get the ok on my finished project proposal. When I hear back , I can organize meeting with those from which I need signatures.

### December 22, 2018:

I've put my project on hold for a while and I just quit soccer to dedicate time to my eagle project. I met with Mr. Walton to discuss a timeframe for the project for half an hour.

### January 13, 2019:

I just sent my eagle proposal to my project coach for approval. I've put aside a lot of my other important obligations to focus on my eagle project. He said everything was good, but asked for some minor changes.

### January 16, 2019:

I went to a meeting for the Pass the Torch Board of Directors. I handed out a couple copies of my proposal and an image of a rendering of the finished woodshed. I got signatures from everyone on my proposal except the district representative. I got a lot of good advice and some next steps to take. There are still some crucial parts of the project that I must resolve before I can really start. I detailed these in the project plan.

### January 23, 2019:

I reached out to Mr. Christopher Cleasby, the district representative from which I need a signature to begin planning my project. He responded and we set up a meeting at Starbucks.

### January 25, 2019:

I has a quick meeting with my project coach to discuss what I'm going to do next. We addressed a couple of concerns that the board brought up last week. I need to make sure that the City of Melbourne won't have an issue with me cementing fence posts in the ground. Also, I need to figure out exactly what will make up the siding: T1-11 siding or Hardie Board.

### January 29, 2019:

I finally met with Mr. Cleasby at Starbucks. He was very helpful and gave some good suggestions for considerations to keep in mind during this process. He said to refer to the Guide to Safe Scouting in order to regulate who can use what tools and to take all the necessary safety precautions when I have work days. He also asked that I set a more definite timeframe for when I want to complete the project. I got his signature, so I was done with my proposal.

### February 20, 2019:

I have procrastinated doing my project for three weeks, which I am disappointed about. I want to finish this without waiting until the last minute. I had another quick meeting with my project coach to take my bearings. I am trying to make an effort to be active in the troop since I will be leaving soon--I want my board of review to go well.

### February 24, 2019:

I just wrote a first draft of my fundraising letter. I outlined how I've worked to achieve Life Scout and how I need to do an Eagle project to achieve Eagle Scout rank. I shared it with my project coach for a second opinion.

### April 17, 2019:

After a lot of back and forth, I got my fundraiser form approved by the district and sent out my donation letters. I now have around $1500 for my project, I will need to evaluate if this is enough or if I will need more. I think I will close donations soon. I just finished logging all my donations so far.

### May 5, 2019:

I got most of my donations and ended up with about $1750. This is more than enough for the woodshed.

### June 11, 2019:

I've been busy with finishing school lately, so I haven't concentrated much on my eagle project. Today, I met with Mr. Jack Ghiz and my project mentor, Mr. Walton. I asked for his opinion on materials I plan to use, how I go about building the woodshed. I learned a lot from the meeting and decided to make a few changes to the CAD drawing reflecting them. I decided to use corrugated tin for the roof instead of shingles and HardiePlank lap siding instead of traditional wooden siding.

### June 27, 2019:

I've been working on some merit badge requirements. I still have six before I have all the MBs I need for Eagle rank. I had a meeting with Mr. Walton and showed him the new modifications in my CAD drawing. I am working on finishing my project plan. We put a day on the calendar, Thursday, August 1, to hold the first workday and start the project.

### July 22, 2019:

I've been emailing my project mentor and moving along. Today, after having to cancel a previous time, we went shopping at Home Depot and bought most of the materials that we needed for the project. I walked around and grabbed all the sizes I needed, we checked out, then hauled them by trailer to the worksite.

### July 31, 2019

I had to cancel the first workday because I was sick and thought I might have strep throat. I was also behind on planning. We moved the first day to Saturday, August 3.

### August 2, 2019

I've been working on the planning for the workdays. I've written an agenda and gotten it approved, so we're ready for tomorrow. I asked to borrow a compound saw from one of the scout leaders for the workday.

### August 3, 2019

Today was the first workday. I got to the worksite at about 10:30am and grabbed the tools or materials I needed and brought them to the worksite. It was difficult to find a first aid kit as no one knew where it was. I should have known ahead of time where there was a first aid kit. I got one a few hours into the day. It was difficult to find volunteers because I did not give enough notice to everyone to get enough volunteers. I was able to get enough in the end by rerouting some scouts working on a different project the same day. We started on time with an opening prayer at 12:30pm. I rallied everyone up, gave them a safety briefing, and an overview of the project. Our goal for today was to dig four holes in the ground, put a 4x4x12' into each, then put cement so they stay in place as the foundation for the woodshed. We started trying to map the spots with twine and wooden stakes. It was very difficult to get the volunteers to make a rectangle that was good enough. I asked Rylan, one of the volunteers, who did his project recently, how he mapped it out with the twine. He showed me a different way that worked much better. We mapped out the foundation, marked spots, and started digging. The workday got a lot easier after we knew where to dig. Once we finished digging we were able to get two of the four poles in the ground before it started pouring. I was looking at my agenda throughout the workday to make sure we were staying on schedule. It rained hard for about twenty minutes before we could go outside and continue. I almost had to call it off and postpone. When we went back, we were able to put the last two poles in the ground. When we finished the day's work, I held a closing prayer, thanked everyone for their help, then dismissed them. There was nothing else to do, so me and my brother went home. I was happy that I was able to achieve our goal for today, but I didn't properly plan for this workday. I need to give more notice to the volunteers to decide to signup.

### August 6, 2019
