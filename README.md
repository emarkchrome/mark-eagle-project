# Mark Nifakos Eagle Project

## Project Log

### December 22, 2017:

I briefed my scoutmaster over an abstract idea for the project. He told me I needed to get someone at the Parks and Rec. department to validate my proposal. I was also told that I need to research what the project entails, cost, potential for scout labor; all of this compiled into an informal glimpse of the problem and solution I can tell my contact at Parks and Rec.

### January 29, 2018:

I sent an email to Cassie Warthen, the chairwoman of the Satellite Beach Parks and Recreation department, outlining my plan for a net to prevent soccer balls from landing in a deep water-filled ditch on the outskirts of the field.

### February 13, 2018:

I got a response from Mrs. Warthen by email. She said that the DeSoto Soccer fields would be under construction later in the calendar year; consequently, it would not be ideal for my project according to her. She asked if I had time to meet with her to come up with other ideas for projects around Satellite Beach.

### February 15, 2018:

I have fallen ill with a severe sinus infection this week; this I counted in an email to Mrs. Warthen and that I would communicate with her when I recovered. After this I received no further correspondence from Mrs. Warthen, despite my clear approbation of her willingness to respond in the final line of the email. I have resolved to scrap the net idea and look for project opportunities with the Pass the Torch Inc nonprofit, recently incorporated on 2401 Post Road.

### February 25, 2018:

I met with Dan Walton, my scoutmaster and one of the board members of Pass the Torch Inc, at a café. We discussed several projects that will need to be constructed as some point or another at the building on 2401 Post Road.

### June 5, 2018:

I decided to build a woodshed on the south side of the main building as my project. I again met with Mr. Walton to go over the process of planning and executing an Eagle project. I left with a detailed plan for how to complete the requirements in order and a project proposal sheet. I am able to access on our troop website a list of previous Eagle scouts and their documents they wrote when planning their own projects.

### June 19, 2018:

I began making CAD drawings to produce a rendering of the finished project in nearly full detail.

### July 11, 2018:

I completely finished the CAD drawings. The only thing left is to tweak the measurements to make workable 2D technical drawings, which I plan to do after my proposal is approved.

### July 17, 2018:

I send the email to get the ok on my finished project proposal. I hope to hear back soon from Mr. Dan Walton; then, I can organize meeting with those from which I need signatures.
