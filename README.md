# Mark Nifakos Eagle Project

## Project Log

### December 22, 2017:

I briefed my scoutmaster over an abstract idea for the project. He told me I needed to get someone at the Parks and Rec. department to validate my proposal. I was also told that I need to research what the project entails, cost, potential for scout labor; all of this compiled into an informal glimpse of the problem and solution I can tell my contact at Parks and Rec.

### January 29, 2018:

I sent an email to Cassie Warthen, the chairwoman of the Satellite Beach Parks and Recreation department, outlining my plan for a net to prevent soccer balls from landing in a deep water-filled ditch on the outskirts of the field.

### February 13, 2018:

I got a response from Mrs. Warthen by email. She said that the DeSoto Soccer fields would be under construction later in the calendar year; consequently, it would not be ideal for my project according to her. She asked if I had time to meet with her to come up with other ideas for projects around Satellite Beach.

### February 15, 2018:

I have fallen ill with a severe sinus infection this week; this I counted in an email to Mrs. Warthen and that I would communicate with her when I recovered. After this I received no further correspondence from Mrs. Warthen, despite my clear approbation of her willingness to respond in the final line of the email. I have resolved to scrap the net idea and look for project opportunities with the Pass the Torch Inc nonprofit, recently incorporated on 2401 Post Road.

### February 25, 2018:

I met with Dan Walton, my scoutmaster and one of the board members of Pass the Torch Inc, at a café. We discussed several projects that will need to be constructed as some point or another at the building on 2401 Post Road.

### June 5, 2018:

I decided to build a woodshed on the south side of the main building as my project. I again met with Mr. Walton to go over the process of planning and executing an Eagle project. I left with a detailed plan for how to complete the requirements in order and a project proposal sheet. I am able to access on our troop website a list of previous Eagle scouts and their documents they wrote when planning their own projects.

### June 19, 2018:

I began making CAD drawings to produce a rendering of the finished project in nearly full detail.

### July 11, 2018:

I completely finished the CAD drawings. The only thing left is to tweak the measurements to make workable 2D technical drawings, which I plan to do after my proposal is approved.

### July 17, 2018:

I send the email to get the ok on my finished project proposal. When I hear back , I can organize meeting with those from which I need signatures.

### December 22, 2018:

I've put my project on hold for a while and I just quit soccer to dedicate time to my eagle project. I met with Mr. Walton to discuss a timeframe for the project for half an hour.

### January 13, 2019:

I just sent my eagle proposal to my project coach for approval. I've put aside a lot of my other important obligations to focus on my eagle project. He said everything was good, but asked for some minor changes.

### January 16, 2019:

I went to a meeting for the Pass the Torch Board of Directors. I handed out a couple copies of my proposal and an image of a rendering of the finished woodshed. I got signatures from everyone on my proposal except the district representative. I got a lot of good advice and some next steps to take. There are still some crucial parts of the project that I must resolve before I can really start. I detailed these in the project plan.

### January 23, 2019:

I reached out to Mr. Christopher Cleasby, the district representative from which I need a signature to begin planning my project. He responded and we set up a meeting at Starbucks.

### January 25, 2019:

I has a quick meeting with my project coach to discuss what I'm going to do next. We addressed a couple of concerns that the board brought up last week. I need to make sure that the City of Melbourne won't have an issue with me cementing fence posts in the ground. Also, I need to figure out exactly what will make up the siding: T1-11 siding or Hardie Board.

### January 29, 2019:

I finally met with Mr. Cleasby at Starbucks. He was very helpful and gave some good suggestions for considerations to keep in mind during this process. He said to refer to the Guide to Safe Scouting in order to regulate who can use what tools and to take all the necessary safety precautions when I have work days. He also asked that I set a more definite timeframe for when I want to complete the project. I got his signature, so I was done with my proposal.

### February 20, 2019:

I have procrastinated doing my project for three weeks, which I am disappointed about. I want to finish this without waiting until the last minute. I had another quick meeting with my project coach to take my bearings. I am trying to make an effort to be active in the troop since I will be leaving soon--I want my board of review to go well.

### February 24, 2019:

I just wrote a first draft of my fundraising letter. I outlined how I've worked to achieve Life Scout and how I need to do an Eagle project to achieve Eagle Scout rank. I shared it with my project coach for a second opinion.
